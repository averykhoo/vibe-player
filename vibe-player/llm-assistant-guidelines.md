* always have a comment at the start and end of every file that includes the file path and name
* when writing a file, include section header comments if the file is long and does more than one conceptual task
* all edits are to be:
  * single line changes, show before and after
  * entire function replacements, show the skeleton before and the full code after
  * entire section of the file, starting and ending at section comments
  * entire file changes
* write file and function docstrings with types, ideally compatible with pycharm's js support

todo:
* fft library structure is unusual, something about .forward
* hybrid processor is not hybrid
