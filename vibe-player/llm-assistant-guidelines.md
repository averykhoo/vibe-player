* always have a comment at the start and end of every file that includes the file path and name
* when writing a file, include section header comments if the file is long and does more than one conceptual task
* all edits are to be:
    * single line changes, show before and after
    * if changes are in one function, provide entire function replacements: show the skeleton before and the full code after
    * entire section of the file, starting and ending at section comments
    * entire file changes
* when multiple files / sections need changes:
    * show one changed block / entire function / entire (modified, working, fixed) file in a response
    * start the response with a tracker of which files have been fixed, which are going to be fixed
    * print the entire thing for me to copy paste
    * if it's a single line block, shoe before and after
    * if a file is to be moved, reverted, or deleted, just say so
    * and also explain what will be fixed in the current file or segment
    * i will manually copy the entire file over and let you know when i'm done
* write file and function docstrings with types, ideally compatible with pycharm's js support
* anything unclear, check with me first before doing anything, i'll clarify and we can continue
* don't start by generating a solution. first discuss the solution with me, confirm that its right, and ask before you start generating the first code block.

todo:

* fft library structure is unusual, something about .forward
